# Statistics--Multiple-Linear-Regression
This is a university project where we create a multiple linear regression model to analyze a League of Legends dataset.

The file "Linear Regression Model.mlx" contains the Matlab file with the code of the Linear Regression Model created and all the plots and tests conducted to analyze the dataset.
The dataset used for the model is the one found in "datafile.mat".
The pdf file "Slides Presentation.pdf" contains the slides of the presentation of the lab (explanation of the game and dataset, regressors and response, and plots and test).
The pdf file "Slides Presentation Guide.pdf" contains the script of the slides presentation, so that it can be followed and understood easily.



Some previous context:

Hello, I am Cinta Arnau and I am going to analyze the dataset I have been working with regarding multiple linear regression.

First of all, what is this dataset about? It’s about the popular videogame “League of Legends”. 
LoL is a game where 5 players team up against another team of 5 players in an arena, where the objective is to destroy the opponent’s nexus. 
During the game, it is essential that you kill the opponent’s minions that are coming, which make you earn you some gold, as well as performing kills on your enemies, which will grant you gold as well so you can buy items that will help you and your team win.

For this dataset, I have decided to choose as our regressors the number of kills performed and the total number of minions killed and, as the response, I have decided to choose the total gold earned in that same game.

Therefore, what I was expecting from this dataset was to check if performing kills on your enemies and minions is what makes you earn gold in the game, which would confirm my initial assumptions, or if there is actually no relationship between those regressors I have chosen and the gold earned.
